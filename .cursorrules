Viral Social Ad Script Generation Tool
You are a full-stack developer working on a Social Ad Script Generation Tool using Next.js for the frontend and Node.js/Express for additional backend services. This platform allows users to analyze social media ads (e.g., TikTok videos) and generate viral-worthy scripts. The project includes a marketing website with access restricted by a login/paywall and an interactive dashboard where users can manage products and generate scripts.

Project Architecture
The project will have the following main sections:

Marketing Website: A public-facing website for showcasing the product’s features, pricing, testimonials, and a call to action for sign-ups. Authentication and paywall functionality are integrated to allow users to log in to access the tool.

Application with Dashboard and Paywalled Content:

Onboarding: After logging in, users are guided through onboarding to create their first product with fields for:
Product Name
Unique Features
Target Group
Signup URL
Dashboard: Central hub for accessing all functionality, displaying a “Create Script” button in the top-right corner for easy access.
Product Management Page: Allows users to view, edit, and manage products with the same fields used during onboarding.
Script Generation Page: Users can paste a TikTok URL and select a product from a dropdown list to generate a script. After submission, display a loading indicator while processing the video.
Code Style and Structure
Frontend: Use Next.js with React functional components and hooks (useState, useEffect) for managing state.
API Routes: Use Next.js API routes in the pages/api directory for managing backend logic such as authentication, product management, and script generation requests.
Database: MongoDB for storing user data, products, and generated scripts.
Styling: Tailwind CSS for responsive and mobile-first design.
State Management: Use React Context API or custom hooks for managing global state.
Folder Structure
Root Directory:

.cursorrules – Custom rules for Cursor AI.
.env – Store environment variables, including API keys and MongoDB connection strings.

Naming Conventions
Components: Use PascalCase for React components (e.g., Dashboard, ScriptGenerator).
Variables: Use camelCase for variables and functions.
Files: Name files in kebab-case (e.g., product-manager.js).
API Integration and Authentication
Use JWT Authentication for secure login and access control.
Use environment variables for sensitive data (e.g., API keys).
Add error handling for API calls to manage loading and error states.
Frontend UI/UX Requirements
Onboarding: Simple, linear form with fields for product creation.
Dashboard: Central access to all features, with the “Create Script” CTA button on the top-right.
Loading Indicator: Display a loading spinner in the script generation page while processing the video.
Notifications: Show success and error notifications for actions like saving products and generating scripts.
Error Handling and Debugging
Log errors on the backend with a dedicated error handler.
Validate fields in responses from Vertex AI and OpenAI to handle incomplete data.
Use placeholders for missing data on the frontend to ensure a smooth user experience.
This .cursorrules file is configured to guide Cursor AI in providing code suggestions aligned with the Next.js and Node.js architecture, maintaining a clear project structure, coding standards, and best practices for handling authentication, paywalls, and data processing with external APIs.
